This project Techtopia, was created in a effort to display my front-end development skills and to create a project that I have been passionate about. I wanted to mimic a social media website for tech-individuals, and I built Techtopia. This project is completed using HTML, CSS, and script.js. Homepage displays your connections, upcoming events in the tech industry, and your feed displays what posts that have been liked, shared, and commented on. Clcking on your profile has a dropdown where you can change the background from light to dark or dark to light mode, also allowing you to view settings. The profile page displays your connections and posts, along with your feed. Please view the project and enjoy!
